APRS Object Sender - ESP32 to APRS-IS Server

A simple ESP32-based circuit that allows you to statically send objects to an APRS server. You can enter 5 objects, a location, an icon, and a comment. A scheduler allows you to send at specific times. A unit converter converts the location from Google Maps to APRS-compatible values. The APRS password generator will calculate the password for your callsign. In the settings, you can change the SSID and Wi-Fi password (you must enter the first SSID and password in the code!), as well as change the NTP server and time zone.

Simply compile it on Arduino and upload it to the ESP32.
